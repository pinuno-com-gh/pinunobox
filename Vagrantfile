  # NOTE: This will enable public access to the opened port

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various

  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
   config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|

  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  # # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:

	vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", 2048]
	vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--name", "pinunobox"]
